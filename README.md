## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  

###  **Tutorial 1: Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms**  
The first tutorial explores the **Bandit Problem**, implementing and analyzing different action-selection strategies:  

âœ… **Random Policy**  
âœ… **Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm**  
âœ… **Softmax Exploration**  
âœ… **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**  

ðŸ“Š Comparative analysis of these algorithms is conducted to evaluate their performance in different settings.

### **Tutorial 2: MENACE - A Tic-Tac-Toe Learning System**
The second tutorial focuses on MENACE (Matchbox Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine), a physical reinforcement learning system designed by Donald Michie to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

âœ… **Understanding MENACE's Box-based Learning Approach**
âœ… **Implementation of MENACE in Python**
âœ… **Training MENACE to Improve Gameplay**
âœ… **Analysis of MENACE's Learning over Multiple Rounds**

ðŸ“ˆ This tutorial demonstrates how reinforcement learning principles can be applied even without traditional programming.
